# Real-TimePose
Implementation of MediaPipe Pose by Google.

MediaPipe Pose is a ML solution for high-fidelity body pose tracking, inferring 33 3D landmarks and background segmentation mask on the whole body from RGB video frames utilizing BlazePose.
This method achieves real-time performance on most modern mobile phones, desktops/laptops, in python and even on the web.

Using a detector, the pipeline first locates the person/pose region-of-interest (ROI) within the frame. The tracker subsequently predicts the pose landmarks and segmentation mask within the ROI using the ROI-cropped frame as input. Note that for video use cases the detector is invoked only as needed, i.e., for the very first frame and when the tracker could no longer identify body pose presence in the previous frame. For other frames the pipeline simply derives the ROI from the previous frameâ€™s pose landmarks.
